### Algorithm trading
Small project in python exploring basic trading algorithms such as simple momentum and moving average crossover. I analysed performance by backtesting on 20 years of past data and comparing to a baseline of simply buying the stock and holding. I also used python libraries like pandas and numpy to plot buy and sell actions on price history to review algorithm performance.
